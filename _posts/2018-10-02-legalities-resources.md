In 2017/18 we worked closely with CCC to produce a document covering many of the frequently asked questions regarding legislation and when consents are required. It is a very valuable read if you're interested in building or hosting a tiny house, particularly in Christchurch.

In September '18 we held a workshop on legislation, inviting a few CCC members to give us an overview and answer some community questions. You can find a recording of this here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgj2ygnI_ZI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgj2ygnI_ZI) (sorry for the poor quality).
