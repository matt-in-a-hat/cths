## What is a Tiny House?
Tiny Houses typically have all of the main amenities you use in a normal house, but in a space-efficient and cosy manner. Often they're movable e.g. built on a trailer.

## What are the benefits?
Tiny Houses are an affordable and flexible option, especially for first home buyers. They support a minimalist culture and reduce demand on the environment. They also get around many of the costly consent processes.

## What does the Society do?
We host social events and learning workshops to engage the community and share knowledge. We also actively share and maintain info via the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/christchurchtinyhousecommunity/ "Christchurch tiny house facebook").
