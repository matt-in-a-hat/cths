We are a group of Cantabrians with a common interest in tiny houses and the tiny house movement. While the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/christchurchtinyhousecommunity/about/) has been around for many years, this not-for-profit society was established in about 2017. We hold public events in the form of social picnics, workshops, and presentations, to meet our general aims of:

* Providing and enabling a collaborative space that informs, connects, supports and provides a hub of information for those interested in Tiny Houses;
* Advocating and engaging proactively with policy makers on behalf of the Tiny House Community to enable a regulatory framework that establishes tiny houses as a legitimate form of housing;
* Actively encouraging members to build and maintain tiny houses which are safe and have minimal impact on the environment, local resources, and other people;
* Educate and collaborate to form a harmonious relationship with policy makers and the wider community
