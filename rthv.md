## The Village

The Riverlution Tiny House Village (the Village) is an intentional community of Tiny Houses on Wheels that is looking to be established in Richmond, Christchurch. The Village has close working relationships with Christchurch City Council, Land Information New Zealand, the Avon-Ōtākaro Network, and Avebury House - all of which have provided much support to the Village. The Village is a partner in the “Riverlution” movement to revitalise Richmond’s community for improved social and environmental wellbeing, alongside Avebury House, Riverlution Cafe, Riverlution Community Garden, and others.


Our small towable dwellings are of the "Tiny Houses on Wheels" movement aesthetic. They are purpose-built to allow one or more persons to live in - including kitchen, bathroom and sleeping facilities. The Village prioritises the specific and special nature of the Tiny Houses on Wheels lifestyle because it is low cost (especially relevant during Aotearoa's current housing affordability crisis), sustainable (minimal impact on the land and remain moveable when required), and encourages community (due to shared land, facilities, and values).


The Village is to be established in the Richmond area of the Christchurch City Red Zone. We aim to nurture an intetional community of like-minded individuals who will support Red Zone revitalisation by adding social, environmental and economic benefits to the area. Richmond’s Red Zone was predominantly residential area, and has lost a lot of community as it has transitioned into Red Zone land. Much of that land is currently sitting empty while future uses are being decided. Some of that land, particularly around the Avon, is not suitable for traditional foundation-based housing, but it is suitable for adaptable, non-permanent housing options such as Tiny Houses on Wheels.


By temporarily utilising this available land, the Village has the opportunity to show-case alternative systems for housing and infrastructure. The Village’s living processes encourage recycling our wastes and enhancing the immediate area instead of adding burden to the environment and city infrastructure. The Village aims to nurture and improve the health of the land, supporting and adding to the native plants and local wildlife. Along the way it is the Village’s intention to share the knowledge we learn about areas of interest that include sustainable living, kaitiakitanga, creating and re-engaging communities, and working with local authorities to help each other achieve these results.

The Village itself will comprise of the communities' own tiny houses which they already own and will move into the village once established. Other than that, there will be a minimal amount of infrastructure installed to support the community, such as water/power/internet, paths and lighting, and a shared space for laundering and bicycle parking.

## Status

The Village is currently well into the planning phase. Earlier in 2023 we obtained a lease for our preferred site to allow futher investigation, and as of June we're organising site-specific plans of how the village will look and what infrastructure is required. We're also now engaging the immediate community, and consulting with a range of stakeholders to apply for the full lease from CCC and to apply for funding to help with the initial infrastructure.

If you are interested and able to provide any support (e.g. with any of the infrastructure install or community engagement), please [get in touch](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenvvZvX1UltQDRBTVayOeYfnEymsLGI2ucBxIxkTP5Ocb5kg/viewform?usp=sf_link). If would be keen to join the Village with your own tiny house, and you align with our Vision below, let us know!

## Village Community Vision

Our intentional community of tiny houses on wheels strives to cultivate a balance between our shared values of ...

* **Community Engagement.** We engage with each other and the greater community (present and past) to add social, environmental and economic benefits.
* **Test bed and knowledge-sharing.** We test new ideas, embrace change and share our knowledge around alternative systems for housing and infrastructure, such as on-site greywater processing and composting toilet systems.
* **Kaitiakitanga.** We live sustainably as environmental stewards, nurturing and enhancing the wellbeing of the land and acknowledging those that were here before.
* **Self-governance.** We aim for egalitarian relationships by practising consent decision making.
* **Inclusivity.** We live with integrity by respecting diversity and embracing everyone’s contributions, abilities, and gifts.
* **Resilience.** A community that can adapt and persevere in the face of change e.g. natural disasters.
* **Replication.** To build a framework that will enable future intentional communities to benefit from our experiences.
